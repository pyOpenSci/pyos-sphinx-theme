# The pyOpenSci documentation theme

A lightweight theme built on the pydata sphinx theme for use with the [pyOpenSci](https://pyopensci.org) project.
It makes minimal changes to the `pydata sphinx theme` in order to standardize a top-bar that can be shared across all pyOpenSci projects.

It does these two primary things:

- Adds some CSS that standardizes the look and feel according to the pyOpenSci brand.

Other than this, the theme behaves the exact same as the [pydata sphinx theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io).
